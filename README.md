Code snippets and tutorials for working with social science data in PySpark

If you're new to Python entirely, consider trying an intro tutorial first.  
Python is a language that stresses readability of code, so it won't be too
difficult to dive right in.  One good interactive tutorial is here:

http://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21

After that, or if you're already comfortable with Python basics, get started
with pySpark with these two lessons:

_basic 1.ipynb_

_basic 2.ipynb_ 

They will assume you are comfortable with what Python code looks like and in
general how it works, and lay out some things you will need to know to 
understand the other lessons.

Basic data tasks are covered in the following guides.  Note that these are not
intended to be comprehensive!  They cover many of the things that are most
common, but others may require you to look them up.  Hopefully this framework
gives you enough to get started.

_merging.ipynb_

_missing data.ipynb_

_pivoting.ipynb_

_resampling.ipynb_

_subsetting.ipynb_
